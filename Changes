=over 3

=item 1.03 - June 19, 2003

Instrumented Makefile.PL to unconditionally remove any old
pre-installed occurrences of Apache/test.pm, which has been renamed to
Apache/testold.pm in mod_perl 1.28 to avoid collisions with
Apache/Test.pm on case-insensitive systems. [Stas]

Apache::TestClient now handles correctly responses with no body and
its response header() method is no longer case-sensitive [Stas]

add skip helper shortcuts: have_min_perl_version,
have_min_module_version [Stas]

pass to 'use lib' only 'lib/' dirs that actually exist in
autogenerated t/TEST t/SMOKE and others. [Stas]

add the ASF LICENSE file to the distro [Stas]

get rid of Apache::TestTrace's dependency on Apache::TestConfig as it
creates too many circular use() problems. [Stas]

wrap blib loading in eval block (added to autogenerated files), to
prevent 'make clean' failures. [Stas]

add two more variants of each of the tracing functions. If the '_mark'
suffix is appended (e.g., 'error_mark') the trace will start with the
filename and the line number the function was called from. If the
'_sub' suffix is appended (e.g., 'error_info') the trace will start
with the name of the subroutine the function was called from. [Stas]

add support for a new env var APACHE_TEST_TRACE_LEVEL, used to
override the tracing level. It propogates the overriden (either by env
var APACHE_TEST_TRACE_LEVEL or -trace option) value to the
server-side, so we can use Apache::TestTrace in mod_perl handlers, and
be able enable/disable tracing from the commmand line. This way we
don't have to comment out debug prints. [Stas]

=item 1.02

not released

=item 1.01 - May  1, 2003

improved support for 3rd party modules test configuration setup:
automatically include 'use blib' in autogenerated t/TEST and add 'use
Apache2' in the startup file for mod_perl 2.0. [Stas]

new configuration option: -libmodperl [path/to/]mod_perl.so (so one
can build several DSO objects, rename them, so several builds can
co-exist under the same LIBEXECDIR and test them all. Mainly useful
for testing 3rd party modules, with different mod_perl DSO builds. [Stas]

set $Apache::Test5005compat::VERSION because of the bogus warnings
generated by EU::MM::parse_version() when it sees
$NOT_THIS_MODULE::VERSION [Randal L. Schwartz <merlyn@stonehenge.com>]

a few fixes in Makefile.PL and t/TEST.PL to work with perl-5.005_03
[Stas]

perlpods are found either in the 'pods/' or 'pod/' subdirs [Randal
L. Schwartz <merlyn@stonehenge.com>]

Autoconfigure Alias /getfiles-* only if the corresponding targets
exist [Stas]

=item 1.00 - Apr 28, 2003 

when inheriting httpd.conf on some platforms SERVER_CONFIG_FILE is an
absolute path, so try to use that if found. [Haroon Rafique
<haroon.rafique@utoronto.ca>]

new Apache::Test functions: 
have_min_apache_version - to require a minimal Apache version. 
have_apache_version     - to require a specific Apache version. 
[Stas]

Apache::TestUtil API change:
write_perl_script  => t_write_perl_script
write_shell_script => t_write_shell_script 
chown              => t_chown
All 3 functions are now optionally exported [Geoffrey Young].

Provide a new request macro _BODY_ASSERT to replace _BODY in cases
where the client part of the test directly prints to the output, in
order to avoid skipped tests instead of reporting the failure of the
server side. Use it in automatically generated tests. [Stas]

httpd (1.3 && 2) / winFU have problems when the first path's segment
includes ':' (security precaution which breaks the rfc) so we can't
use /TestFoo::bar as path_info in Apache::Tests. Adjusting all tests
to use /TestFoo__bar. [Stas]

change Apache::TestConfig::filter_args to accept arguments which
aren't only key/value pairs, but also tokens like 'FOO=1' [Stas]

In autogenerated t/TEST, make sure not to include 'use Apache2' for
the mod_perl 2.0 build itself [Stas]

avoid starting httpd with 'Group root' when running the test suite
under root [Stas]

add support for 'make test TEST_VERBOSE=1 "TEST_FILES=foo bar"' [Stas]

Apache::Test now can run 'make test' under 'root', without permission
problems (e.g. when files need to be written), it'll chown all the
files under t/ to the user chosen to run the server with, before
running the tests and will restore the permissions at the end. [Stas]

don't inherit loading of the mod_perl object from the system-wide
config, since Apache::TestRunPerl already configures it [Stas]

Support two new shortcuts for skip functionality:
 - have_threads: checks whether both Apache and Perl support threads
 - under_construction: to print a consistent/clear skip reason
[Stas]

Support <NoAutoConfig> </NoAutoConfig> blocks in .pm files, so we can
have a full manual control over generated config sections. These
sections are fully parsed and variables are substituted, including
vhosts. [Stas]

Implement a more robust autogenerated client .t test in
Apache::TestConfigPerl. Before this fix if the server side returned
500, the test would get skipped, not good. Now it will die a horrible
death. [Stas]

Before v1.0 most changes were logged in modperl-2.0/Changes (see
mod_perl <= v1.99_08).
