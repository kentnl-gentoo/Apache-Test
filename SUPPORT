The Apache-Test project is co-maintained by several developers, who
take turns at making CPAN releases. Therefore you may find several
CPAN directories containing Apache-Test releases. The best way to find
the latest release is to use http://search.cpan.org/.

If you have a question or you want to submit a bug report or make a
contribution, please do not email individual authors, but send an
email to the test-dev <at> httpd.apache.org mailing list. This list is
moderated, so unless you are subscribed to it, your message will have
to be approved first by a moderator. Therefore please allow some time
(up to a few days) for your post to propagate to the list.
