The Apache-Test project is co-maintained by several developers, who
take turns at making CPAN releases. Therefore you may find several
CPAN directories containing Apache-Test releases. The best way to find
the latest release is to use http://search.cpan.org/.

If you have a question or you want to submit a bug report or make a
contribution, please do not email individual authors, but send an
email to the test-dev <at> httpd.apache.org mailing list. This list is
moderated, so unless you are subscribed to it, your message will have
to be approved first by a moderator. Therefore please allow some time
(up to a few days) for your post to propagate to the list.

If 'make test' fails to start, with an error message:

  !!! no test server configured, please specify an httpd or apxs or put
  either in your PATH. For example: t/TEST -httpd /path/to/bin/httpd

or similar, please don't submit a bug report, since this is a user
error, not a bug in Apache-Test. Instead, do what the error message
suggests; Apache-Test needs to know where it can find Apache and other
components. If you have apxs installed you can run the test suite via:

  % t/TEST -apxs /path/to/bin/apxs

or if you set the APXS environment variable, via make:

  % APXS=/path/to/bin/apxs make test

If you don't have 'apxs', tell Apache-Test where your httpd can be
found:

  % t/TEST -httpd /path/to/bin/httpd

or via the APACHE environment variable:

  % APACHE=/path/to/bin/httpd make test
